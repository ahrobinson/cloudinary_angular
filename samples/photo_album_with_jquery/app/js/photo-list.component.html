<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<p>
  This is the main demo page of the PhotoAlbum sample AngularJS application of Cloudinary.<br />
  Here you can see all images you have uploaded to this application and find some information on how
  to implement your own AngularJS application storing, manipulating and serving your photos using Cloudinary!
</p>

<p>
  All of the images you see here are transformed and served by Cloudinary.
  For instance, the logo and the poster frame.
  They are both generated in the cloud using Cloudinary functions.
  These two pictures weren't even have to be uploaded to Cloudinary, they are retrieved by the service, transformed, cached and distributed through a CDN.
